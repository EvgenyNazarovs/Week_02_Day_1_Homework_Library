# Model a Library as a class.
#
# Create a class for a Library that has an array of books.
# Each book should be a hash with a title, which is a string,
# and rental details, which is another hash with a student name and
# due date.
# This should look something like:
#
#   {
#     title: "lord_of_the_rings",
#     rental_details: {
#      student_name: "Jeff",
#      date: "01/12/16"
#     }
#   }
#
# Create a getter for the books
# Create a method that takes in a book title and returns
# all of the information about that book.
# Create a method that takes in a book title and returns only
# the rental details for that book.
# Create a method that takes in a book title and adds it to our
# book list (add a new hash for the book with the student name
# and date being left as empty strings)
# Create a method that changes the rental details of a book
# by taking in the title of the book, the student renting it
# and the date itâ€™s due to be returned.
